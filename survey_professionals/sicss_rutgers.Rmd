## Social Science Research x Online Surveys

The capacity to recruit participants online to answer surveys/complete tasks has profoundly affect social sciences: 

--
- Reducing the costs of running surveys using high-quality survey panels

--

- Recruit participants from convenience samples ~ Facebook Ads, MTurk, Google ADs, Lucid, etc...

--

- Rely less on students' samples for experiments & be more creative with online experiments. 

--

- Use surveys to collect digital trace data ~ augmenting survey data with social media/online behavioral data

## Challenges: Professional Survey Takers

## Our contributtion

#### User high-quality digital trace data to  identify the prevalence of survey professionalism, and then its consequences for researcher:

--
-  Previous research has relied entirely on self-reports, asking participants how often they do surveys or how many panels they belong to (e.g., Zhang et al. 2020; Matthijsse, De Leeuw, and Hox 2015)
  - Affected by social desirability bias: participants have incentices to hide

--

- We use three samples, recruited through distinct methods (online panel, social media, and market place), combining: 
  - multiple survey waves in each sample
  - Up to 90 days of browsing data for participants.

## Research Questions

- **RQ1** What is the degree of survey professionalism among online panel members? 

- **RQ2** Do survey professionals differ from non-professionals sociodemographically and politically?

- **RQ3** Do survey professionals exhibit higher between-waves response instability than non-professionals? 

- **RQ4** What is the extent to which participants take the same questionnaire more than once, and do survey professionals engage in more repeated participation than non-professionals?

# Data, Measurement and Design

---
## Data

We collect web-browsing (digital trace data), .red[roughly 90 days of data], from participants across three U.S. samples: 

- **Facebook**: participants recruited through Meta Ads; install web-historian app; decide to donate/or not their digital trace data; 707 participants, 16.4 million visits, .red[90 days of data]


- **Lucid**: online market place for surveys; install web-historian app; decide to donate/or not their digital trace data; 2,222 participants, 73.8 million visits, .red[90 days of data]

- **Yougov**: high-quality survey provides; use their own data donation system; users decide to register with the data donation; 957 participants, 6.4 million, only .red[up to 60 days]

## Definying a survey visit

#### Three-steps to define what counts as a survey url using their domain names:

- **Step 1:** Pre-Curated list of survey platforms (Bevec et al, 2021). We manually verify all the links, and end up with 229 platforms. 

- **Step 2:** Classify all hosts that contained the word ``survey'' as survey; Identify another 2,714 URL hosts. 

- **Step 3:**  Manually coded the 500 most frequently visited hosts from each of our three datasets; identify 291 additional URL hosts 



---
## Survey Professionals

We provide four categories of survey professionalism. All results in the presentation us our first category. Results are largely robust across the different categorization. 


- **Definition 1:** a respondent that  has .red[on average more than 100 survey visits] per browsing active day

- **Definition 2:** a respondent that spends .red[more than 50 percent of all browsing time] on survey sites

- **Definition 3:** a respondent that has .red[more than 50 percent of all visits] to survey sites

- **Definition 4:** any of the three categories above.

## Discussion


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Professional survey taking represents a .red[substantial portion] of the online activity of the analyzed samples**

- 34.3% of Lucid,  7.9% of YouGov, 1.7% of Facebook

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Although prevalent, they .red[do not introduce substantive inferential problems]**

- lack of robust cross-sample difference suggests that survey professionalism does not introduce systematic demographic or political bias

- Professionals speed through survey, and are more likely to straightline
   - Observable behaviors:Easy to detect and control for
   
- No evidence of random responses over time

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **One problematic consequence: many participants take one and the .red[same questionnaire repeatedly]**
