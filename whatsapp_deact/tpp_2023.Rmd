## Motivation

**Social Media:** From a liberation to Turmoil .red[(Tucker et. al., 2019)]

**Three insights form the scholarly literature on social media and politics:**

- Exposure to Misinformation follows a power law .red[(Grinberg et al., 2019)]

- The downstream effects of exposure to misinformation on political attitudes are .red[difficult to measure, often small in size, and context dependent]. (See Meta Election Studies + Facebook Deactivation Studies)

- Most of the scholarly evidence come from a .red[advanced democracies] and from a .red[feed-based platforms] (mostly Twitter, and to some extent Facebook)

### WhatsApp Multimedia Deactivation Experiment - Brazil 2022

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Research Problem:] What are the causal effect of WhatsApp usage on beliefs for misinformation and its downstream effects, particularly political polarization?

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Design:] Multimedia-Constrained Deactivation Experiment on WhatsApp:

- Incentivized participants to spent three weeks without accessing any multimedia (images, videos and audio) on WhatsApp.


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Context:] Weeks before the 2022 Presidential Election in Brazil


--
`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Results:] 

- Substantive reduction in **exposure to popular misinformation rumors**.

- Unable to detect small to moderate effects on **attitudes (belief accuracy and polarization)**

- Null-Effects on subjective well-being

--

---

## Limitations

- Scope conditions: focus on direct effects of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp. 

- Effects might be context-dependent

  - Previous deactivation studies found different results in United States (x2), France and Bosnia
  
- Election context: highly polarization

# Tech & Public Policy Proposal

---
## Multi-Country WhatsApp Deactivation

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Research Problem:] What are the causal effect of WhatsApp usage on beliefs for misinformation and its downstream effects, particularly political polarization?

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Design:] Multi-Country Deactivation in three major Global South Democracies with Presidential Elections:

- Country Selection: Mexico, South Africa, India

- High WhatsApp usage + Ethnic and Political Polarization + Misinformation traveling primarely through WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Design:] Interventions: 

- Multimedia Deactivation - Focus on reducing exposure to Misinformation

- Reduction on WhatsApp usage - Full deactivation, >10min per day. 

- Four week period. 

--

---

## Extensions

- Effects of group-based conversations on political polarization (Fall 2024)

- Online Data Donation Tool for Content from WhatsApp Groups (Fall 2024)
  
  - Focus on immigrant communities in the US
  
  - Conditional on time also used in the multi-country deactivation


---
## Progress

- Our first big effort was on building a team of experts and select the countries to run the experiment: 

 + [Joshua Tucker](https://wp.nyu.edu/fas-joshuatucker/): Director of NYUâ€™ Center for Social Media and Politics (CSMaP)

  + [Shelley Liu](https://www.shelleyxliu.com/): Assistant professor at Duke University, Sanford School of Public Policy

  + [Rajeshwari Majumdar](https://r-majumdar.github.io/): PhD Candidate, NYU Politics
    
  + [Carolina Torreblanco](https://carolina-torreblanca.github.io/): PhD Candidate, NYU Politics

---
## Progress

- IRB Review: November and December

- Recruitment: Starting in January

- Deactivation: Early April to May.

# Impact

---
## Causal Effects of WhatsApp on Politics

--
- **Claims about WhatsApp**:

  - Downstream effects on episodes offline violence 
  
  - Affects voting choices in Global South elections
  
  - Facilitates spread of misinformation -> beliefs

--

- **Our work provides the first comparative evidence for the effects of WhatsApp on political outcomes**. 

  - Separates general usage vs direct exposure to misinformation
  
  - Contextual variation
  
--

---
## Causal Effects of WhatsApp on Politics

- **No causal eviedence -> poor policy choices.** 

   - Policymakers and  technologists risk proposing solutions grounded in conventional wisdom, folk theory, or research from heterogeneous contexts. 

---

## The role of multimodal content on spread of misinformation

Our work also focuses on multimodal content: 

- Most academic work has focuses on textual misinformation

- In contexts of low literacy, multimodal content have dominated the misinformation market

  - travel fasters
  
  - easier to understand
  
- Most social media companies have guard-rails focused on text/sources. 

---

## Dissemination Plan

- Main academic conferences in the next year calendar: APSA, IC2S2 & ICA

- Summer 2024: Social Media and Politics Conference at Georgetown (together with John Ladd)

- Open discussions about industry-academic collaborations with Meta/WhatsApp
