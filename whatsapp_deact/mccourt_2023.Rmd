## WhatsApp 101

--

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[WhatsApp]

#### WhatsApp is a worldwide popular end-to-end encrypted messaging app allowing both .red[direct] and .red[group-based] communications with close to 2 billion around the world

]

.panel[.panel-name[Usage in Brazil]


- .red[66% of the Brazilian eligible voters] has a social media account, and .red[65% have an WhatsApp account] ([Datafolha 2018](http://media.folha.uol.com.br/datafolha/2018/10/27/44cc2204230d2fd45e18b039ee8c07a6.pdf)) – 150 million people in 2022. 


- Most used app for all purposes: .red[talk to family & friends, do business & pay bills, consume news, talk politics, among others] ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021)). 


- Used by .red[48% of population to read news], despite having no “news feed” ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021))


- Across the world, .red[Brazilians are the most concerned about misinformation]. And among the most active social media users


- And .red[WhatsApp is the main social media application] where users report to see more misinformation. 
]
.panel[.panel-name[Effects on Politics]

Several claims about the role of WhatsApp on offline attitudes and behaviors: 

- Powerful propaganda and organizational tool for political parties .midgrey[(Chauchard and Garimella, 2022; Gil de Zúñiga et al. 2021)]
- Misinformation led episodes of offline violence against minority groups .midgrey[(Saha et al., 2021; Banaji et al., 2019)] 
- Voting behavior .midgrey[(Tardáguila et al., 2018; Mello, 2020)]

### Our Experiment

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Outcomes:** 
- Exposure and Beliefs to online misinformation, 
- Outgroup polarization 
- Subjective well-being.

.panel[.panel-name[Outcomes]


**Self-Reported Exposure and Accuracy Judgment**

  - False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

**Polarization**

  - Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer).
  - Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter).
  - Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..).
  - Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?').

**Subjective Well-being**

  - How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...).

## Hypotheses

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` H1: Deactivated users will report lower levels of previous exposure to FALSE rumors. .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` H2a: Deactivated  will display a higher ability to accurately identify FALSE rumors. .midgrey[(Fazio et al., 2015; Dechêne et al., 2010; Pennycook et al., 2018)]

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` H2b Deactivated users will display lower levels of mainstream news knowledge. .midgrey[((Valenzuela et al., 2021; Rossini et al., 2021a))]

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` H3: Deactivated will display lower levels of outgroup political polarization. .midgrey[((Bail et al., 2018; Settle, 2018; Lelkes et al., 2017, Omundsmen et. al. 2021)]

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` H4: Deactivated will display higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being. .midgrey[((Allcott et al., 2020; Asimovic et al., 2021; Vanman et al., 2018; Tromholt, 2016)]

## Discussion


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**
--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

--

---
class: middle

### Limitations

--

- scope conditions: focus on direct effects of WhatsApp & and short-term effects.

--

- Do not rule out the use of WhatsApp as a mobilization and organizational tool by malicious actors. 

--

- Largers effect might exist exactly in hard to reach populations.

--

- Small effect size & Power

--

- Electoral context + Motivated Reasoning

--



---
class: middle

## Next steps

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[**Experimental**]

- Multi-Country Deactivation: Mexico, South Africa and India. (TPP Grant)

- Contextual Diversity

- New treatment Arm: overall reduction on WhatsApp usage.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[**Computational**]

- Developing a data donation pipeline for WhatsApp group data

## Examples of Misinformation Outcomes

### False Item: 

_Only complete votes are counted by the electoral justice. If the voter only votes for the President, and votes blank for all the other races, the vote is considered a partial vote, and will be annulled_

### True Item:

_After consecutive reductions, the current oil price in Brazil is below the global average value_
