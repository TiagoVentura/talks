# Motivation

---
class:middle
### Social Media, Misinformation and Politics

--

- **From Liberation to Turmoil**: In the last 10 years, the general public, journalist accounts and the academic research on the effects of social media in society has been dominated by the issue of misinformation (.midgrey[Tucker et. al., 2018])

--

- **A decade after**: gap between public discourse and scientific research on this issue .midgrey[(Budak et. al., 2024)]. Scientific research shows:

  - People aren’t actually exposed to a lot of misinformation – but exposure is heavily concentrated .midgrey[(Grinberg et. al. 2019, Guess et. al. 2019)]
  
  - Nulls effects from in-the-field studies for exposure to misinformation on attitudes .midgrey[(Eady et al. 2023, and Meta papers)]
  
  - Mixed evidence from many deactivation studies on Facebook .midgrey[(Asimovic et. al. 2022, Alcott et. al. 2020, Arcenaux and Ladd 2023)]
    

---
class:middle
### Social Media, Misinformation and Politics

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Majority of scholarly work comes from W.E.I.R.D countries**:

   - Over 80% of existing studies on interventions to correct misinformation focus on Global North countries .midgrey[(Blair et. al. 2023,  Badrinathan and Chauchard, 2023a)]
   
   - Spreading, production and exposure to misinformation differs greatly across the world
   
   - In the Global South:
   
      - Informal networks for information sharing matter more ~ easier to mix true and false information
      - The real-world effects of misinformation exposure may be more pronounced in these countries, fewer fact-checking agencies, for example,
      - Social media messaging apps are more prevalent vs feed-based platforms

### Multimedia Deactivation Experiment in Brazil, 2022

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Problem**: Fully deactivating WhatsApp is neither possible nor ideal

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

## Compliance

**Compliance Tasks:**

- Screenshots of WhatsApp storage intormation 

- Every week + final survey

- After the  first compliance check, the control group was re-activated

---
class:middle

## Outcomes

**Self-Reported Exposure and Accuracy Judgment**

  - False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

**Polarization**

  - Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer).
  - Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter).
  - Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..).
  - Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?').

**Subjective Well-being**

  - How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...).

## Discussion


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Limitation:** single-country, low-powered study: effects are likely larger among subgroups more exposure to misinformation, and vary contextually.

### Extension: Multi-Country Deactivation Experiment


- **Problem**: Single country studies have limited power to speak of contextual effects (and in our case, limited statistical power)

- **Summary**: Multicountry extension across three major Global South countries; Brazil (In the field), India and South Africa

- **Stronger Treatment**: Replicate Multimedia Deactivation + Time Reduction

- **More statistical power**: ~ 2500 participants across the three countries.  

---
class: middle
## Experimental Conditions 

- **Types of partial deactivation**
   -  Time: Limit daily WhatsApp usage to 10 minutes 
   -  Multimedia: Do not consume multimedia content received via WhatsApp

- **Treatment and control**
 
 - Treatment: Change settings and  behavior for .red[4 week (one month)] leading up to elections in South Africa and India
 - Control: Change only behavior for .red[3 days] a month before election


- **2x2 design**

## Implementation 

- Used Meta Advertisements to recruit WhatsApp users in all the three countries
- All participants could earn a total of $15 for completing surveys and uploading weekly screenshots
- Participants in treatment conditions who successfully reduced usage or multimedia consumption received an additional $45 

- Started with 1,498 respondents in SA and IN countries;  1,394 (93\%) completed the endline survey. Currently have 930 participants enrolled in Brazil. 

- Timeline SA and IN:

## Next Steps

- Aggregate results from the Brazil new experiment.

- More HTEs and secondary outcomes to understand divergences in results across countries

-  Analyze compliance data  and estimate complier effects

-  2-week follow-up survey: effects of ``returning'' to WhatsApp?

### WhatsApp Link Explore: A Data Donation Pipeline

- WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted. 

- But, users can easily export their data. This makes Data Donation the easiest (possible only way to collect WhatsApp Data)

- Develop a pipeline using [WhatsApp Web](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js); A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app
---
class:middle
## Data Donation Pipeline: 

- Recruit participants via surveys
  
- Ask them to authenticate in the web app (no need to download anything; but need two devices)
  
- Participants can choose which groups to donate the data. Only allow groups >5 participants.
  
- Collect: 
   - users' metadata, 
   - groups' metadata,
   - messages from donated groups.
   - only collect messages that contains URLs, avoid collecting risky and private content (images, messages, videos.)
