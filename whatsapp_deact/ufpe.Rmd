## Three insights from the recent literature on social media and misinformation. 

---
class: middle 

## 1) People .red[aren’t] actually exposed to a lot of .red[misinformation] – but exposure is heavily concentrated.

## 2) The downstream effects of exposure to misinformation on political atttitudes are .red[difficult to measure, often small in size, and context dependent].

## Today's Presentation

--
.red[Research Problem:] What are the causal effect of WhatsApp usage on beliefs for misinformation and its downstream effects, particularly political polarization?

--

.red[Design:] Multimedia-Constrained Deactivation Experiment on WhatsApp:

- Incentivized participants to spent three weeks without accessing any multimedia (images, videos and audio) on WhatsApp.


--

.red[Context:] Weeks before the 2022 Presidential Election in Brazil


--
.red[Results:] 

- Substantive reduction in **exposure to popular misinformation rumors**.

- Unable to detect small to moderate effects on **attitudes (belief accuracy and polarization)**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .red[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

## Overview of the Experiment

---

## Recruitment

**Method:** Facebook Ads targeting adults Brazil

**Started Recruitment:** September 8th

**Number of respondents:** 1,947

**Screening variables:** 

  + Willingness to join: .red[1,8861 participants]
  
  + More 5min WhatsApp daily

  + Only WhatsApp mobile
  
  + More than 2 min to complete recruitment + other quality controls


---

## Treatment Assignment

.pull-left[

**Start**: September 15.

**Treatment**:

- Turn off the automatic download.
- Three .red[weeks] without consuming any multimedia.
  
**Control**: Three .red[days] without consuming any multimedia.

**Invited**: 1,135 respondents 

**Completed**: 773 respondents

## Outcomes

--

**Self-Reported Exposure and Accuracy Judgment**

  - False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

--

**Polarization**

  - Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer).
  - Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter).
  - Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..).
  - Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?').

--

**Subjective Well-being**

  - How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...).

--

---
class:middle

## Hypotheses

H1: Deactivated users will report lower levels of previous exposure to FALSE rumors.

H2a: Deactivated  will display a higher ability to accurately identify FALSE rumors.

H2b Deactivated users will display lower levels of mainstream news knowledge.

H3: Deactivated will display lower levels of outgroup political polarization.

H4: Deactivated will display higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being.

## Discussion


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**
--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

--

---
class:middle

## Limitations

--

- Scope conditions: focus on direct effects of WhatsApp. 

--

- Larger effect might exist exactly in hard to reach groups.

--

- Small effect size vs power

--

---
class: middle

## Next steps. 

--

### Replication, Replication, Replication

--

---
class:middle

## Extra points for discussion

- Pre-Analysis plan

- Pilot(s)

- Interacting with participants

- Costs of running a field experiment

- Researching on a "natural science" style lab

- PhD in the United States

- Job Market

- etc..
