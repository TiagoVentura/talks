# Motivation

### Social Media, Politics and Misinformation

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Prevalence of misinformation**: 
   -  People aren’t actually exposed to a lot of misinformation – but exposure is heavily concentrated. .midgrey[(Grinberg et. al. 2019, Guess et. al. 2019)]


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Downstream effects on attitudes: less than you think**: 
   - Null effects of exposure to misinformation campaigns from Russian bots on Twitter .midgrey[(Eady et al. 2023)]
   - Mixed evidence from deactivating users from Facebook .midgrey[(Asimovic et. al. 2022, Alcott et. al. 2020, Arcenaux and Ladd 2023)]
   - Meta Election 2020 studies .midgrey[(Guess et al. 2023a,b; Nyhan et al. 2023)]
   

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Majority of scholarly work comes from W.E.I.R.D countries]**:
   - As a consequence we know a lot about feed-based platforms, a little about other social media apps more prevalent in other parts of the world
   - Over 80% of existing studies on interventions to correct misinformation focus on Global North countries 
.midgrey[(Blair et. al. 2023,  Badrinathan and Chauchard, 2023a)]
       - Despite the fact that the real-world effects of misinformation exposure may be more pronounced in these countries.

### Multimedia Deactivation Experiment in Brazil, 2022


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

## Compliance

**Compliance Tasks:**

- Screenshots of WhatsApp storage intormation 

- Every week + final survey

- After the  first compliance check, the control group was re-activated

## Outcomes

**Self-Reported Exposure and Accuracy Judgment**

  - False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

**Polarization**

  - Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer).
  - Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter).
  - Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..).
  - Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?').

**Subjective Well-being**

  - How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...).

## Discussion


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

## Extension: Multi-Country Deactivation Studies

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Reducing WhatsApp Usage to Mitigate Misinformation Exposure During Elections: Evidence from a Multi-Country Experiment] (With Rajeshwari Majumdar, Shelley Liu, Carolina Torreblanca, and Joshua A. Tucker)

--
- **Summary**: Multicountry extension across three major Global South countries; Brazil (In the field), India and South Africa
- **Stronger Treatment**: Replicate Multimedia + Time Reduction
- **More statistical power**: ~ 2500 participants across the three countries.

class: middle
## Experimental Conditions 

- **Types of partial deactivation**
   -  Time: Limit daily WhatsApp usage to 10 minutes 
   -  Multimedia: Do not consume multimedia content received via WhatsApp

- **Treatment and control**
 
 - Treatment: Change settings and  behavior for .red[4 week (one month)] leading up to elections in South Africa and India
 - Control: Change only behavior for .red[3 days] a month before election


- **2x2 design**
