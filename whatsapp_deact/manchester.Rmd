## Research on Social Media and its effects 

- Existing research: focused primarily on feed-based platforms that are popular in advanced democracies (Twitter, Facebook)

- But in the Global South
   -  The types of social media platforms that are predominantly used are fundamentally different (message-based; WhatsApp)
   - Different affordances/platforms shapes the types of misinformation that is more prevalent 
   - Over 80% of existing studies on interventions to correct misinformation focus on Global North countries  .midgrey[(Blair et. al. 2023,  Badrinathan and Chauchard, 2023)]
   - The harmful offline consequences of misinformation exposure may be more pronounced

### Our Experiment

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Problem**: Fully deactivating WhatsApp is neither possible nor ideal

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

## Recruitment

**Method:** Facebook Ads targeting adults Brazil

**Started Recruitment:** September 8th

**Number of respondents:** 1,947

**Screening variables:** 

  + Willingness to join: .red[1,8861 participants]
  
  + More 5min WhatsApp daily

  + Only WhatsApp mobile
  
  + More than 2 min to complete recruitment + other quality controls

---
class:middle
## Treatment Assignment


**Start**: September 15.

**Treatment**:

- Turn off the automatic download.
- Three .red[weeks] without consuming any multimedia.
  
**Control**: Three .red[days] without consuming any multimedia.

**Invited**: 1,135 respondents 

**Enrolled**: 773 respondents

## Compliance

**Compliance Tasks:**

- Screenshots of WhatsApp storage intormation 

- Every week + final survey

- After the  first compliance check, the control group was re-activated

## Outcomes

**Self-Reported Exposure and Accuracy Judgment**

  - False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

**Polarization**

  - Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer).
  - Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter).
  - Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..).
  - Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?').

**Subjective Well-being**

  - How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...).

## Discussion


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

### Next Steps

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Multicountry Deactivation Experiment**: Currently running a multi-country replication of this experiment.

  - **Where:** Three major Global South Democracies: India, South Africa and Brazil.
  - **Interventions:** Two distinct interventions - Multimedia Deactivation and Time Reduction.
  - **Fours weeks** before national elections in India and South Africa and local elections in Brazil.
  - Follow-up survey **two weeks after participants** return to social media.
