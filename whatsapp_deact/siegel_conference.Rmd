### Research on Social Media and Misinformation

class: middle

**The vast majority of the research on social media and misinformation has focused on developed countries, particularly the United States. As a consequence:**

--

- Know very little of social media apps not heavily used in the United States

- Scholarly evidence becomes hard to generalize

- Weak policy recommendations from a global perspective

- At the same time: the consequences of misinformation are potentially larger outside of developed countries (weak institutions)

#### .fade[WhatsApp is a worldwide popular end-to-end encrypted messaging app allowing both direct and ingroup communications with close to 2 billion around the world]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Usage in Brazil]


- .red[66% of the Brazilian eligible voters] has a social media account, and .red[65% have an WhatsApp account] ([Datafolha 2018](http://media.folha.uol.com.br/datafolha/2018/10/27/44cc2204230d2fd45e18b039ee8c07a6.pdf)) – 150 million people in 2022. 


- Most used app for all purposes: .red[talk to family & friends, do business & pay bills, consume news, talk politics, among others] ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021)). 


- Used by .red[48% of population to read news], despite having no “news feed” ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021))


- Across the world, .red[Brazilians are the most concerned about misinformation]. And among the most active social media users


- And .red[WhatsApp is the main social media application] where users report to see more misinformation.

### Even though WhatsApp has received sufficient attention from the media, yet no study has identified causal effects of WhatsApp usage on political outcomes. 


---
class:middle

## Research and Findings

--
.red[Research Problem:] What are the causal effect of WhatsApp usage on beliefs for misinformation and its downstream effects, particularly political polarization?

--

.red[Design:] Deactivation Experiment on WhatsApp

- Incentivized participants to spent three weeks without acccessing any multimedia on WhatsApp

- Three weeks before Presidential Election in Brazil


--
.red[Results:] 

- Substantive reduction in exposure to popular misinformation rumors.

- No improvements in belief accuracy, even though exposure was reduced.

- No changes in polarization and subjective Well-Being.

## Field Experiment: An WhatsApp Multi-Media Deactivation

---
class:middle

## Motivation

Deactivation experiments have been recently used to causally identify the effects of social media on users' behavior and attitudes .red[(Asimovic et al 2021 and Alcott et al 2020)]. 

--

#### Deactivating WhatsApp users is **theoretically and empirically unfeasible**.

- Costs of deactivating on human subjects are too high. 

- Findings from subjects enrolled in a complete deactivation were unlikely to be feasible (issues on external validity)


---
class: middle

## Our Design

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Solution:** Cut channels through which users' are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content .red[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., ND).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp 
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil
- **End:** three days after the voting day

## Outcomes

--
#### .darkblue[Exposure and Belief Accuracy] 

- False Rumors published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True News stories headlines from mainstream media.

--

#### .darkblue[Polarization]

- Affective polarization (Feeling Thermometer)
- Social Polarization (Willingness to engage with outgroup voter)
- Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..)
- Perceptions about ideological polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?')

--

#### .darkblue[Subjective Well-being]

- How did you feel for the past three weeks? (Happy, Anxious, etc...)

--

---
## Examples of Misinformation Outcomes

### False Item: 

_Only complete votes are counted by the electoral justice. If the voter only votes for the President, and votes blank for all the other races, the vote is considered a partial vote, and will be annulled_

### True Item:

_After consecutive reductions, the current oil price in Brazil is below the global average value_

## Hypotheses

H1: Deactivated users will report lower levels of previous exposure to FALSE stories compared to their counterparts  using the regular WhatsApp

H2a: Deactivated  will display a higher ability to accurately identify FALSE information compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.

H2b Deactivated users will display lower levels of mainstream news knowledge compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.

H3: Deactivated will display lower levels of outgroup political polarization compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.

H4: Deactivated will display higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp

## Discussion

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[The null results provide support for a minimalist view of the causal effects of WhatsApp on political attitudes]

# BUT...

--

### It would be a mistake to conclude that WhatsApp plays no role in politics.

--

- scope conditions: focus on direct effects of WhatsApp. 

--

- Do not rule out the use of WhatsApp as a mobilization and organizational tool by malicious actors. 

--

- Largers effect might exist exactly in hard to reach populations.

--

- Small effect size vs Small Sample.

--

- Electoral context + Motivated Reasoning
