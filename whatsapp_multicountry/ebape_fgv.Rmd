## Social Media Effects in Politics
--

**From Liberation to Turmoil:** Over the past decade, public debate about social media usage have increasingly focused on its negative consequences on society. Social media is said to:

--

- Facilitates the spread of misinformation .midgrey[(Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler 2018; Flaxman, Goel, and Rao 2016)]

--

- Facilitates users' self-selection on online echo chambers .midgrey[(Guess et al. 2023; Sunstein 2018)]

--

- Increase exposure to uncivil/low-quality content .midgrey[(Bor and Petersen 2022)]

--

- ... polarizes voters around the world .midgrey[(Banks et al. 2021; Tokita, Guess, and Tarnita 2021; Bail et al. 2018; Settle 2018)]


--

- ... harms mental health .midgrey[(Tromholt 2016; Vanman, Baker, and Tobin 2018; Hanley, Watt, and Coventry 2019)]

### Challenges on Social Media Studies


#### **Challenge 1:**  Overemphasis on feed-based platforms


--

- Information consumption and information spread varies greatly across different social media platforms (Feed-Based vs Social Messaging Apps vs Non-Social Graph Apps) .midgrey[(Garimella et al., 2019, Resende et al., 2019, Ventura et al., 2024)] 

--

- Social media messaging apps are more prevalent in the Global South vs feed-based platforms. 


--

- Messaging apps are encrypted, which makes access to data for researchers really challenging!

--

- With no news feed, most of the viral content has no metadata, no author information, and it travels through quasi-anonymous, multimedia content. 

--

---
class:middle

#### **Challenge 2:** Research is concentrated in a handful of high-income countries .midgrey[(Budak et al.,, 2024)]:


--

- Effects of social media may be distinct in low-income countries: 

  - Less content moderation from platforms, and 
  - Weaker independent media infra-structure
  - Fewer fact-checking agencies and studies on corrections .midgrey[(Blair et al., 2023)], 

--

- Heavier reliance on social media for news .midgrey[(Reuters 2024)]
   
--

-  Similarly,  informal networks for information sharing matter more ~ easier to mix true and false information 

--

---
class:middle

#### **Challenge 3:** Evidence is mostly correlational

### Studying Causal Effects of WhatsApp Usage

--

- **Problem I:** In a context of widely adoption of certain social media applications, RCTs "treating" users with social media have several theoretical and statistical constraints. 
  
   - **Solution:** Instead of "activating", researchers have used deactivation designs to measure the short term causal effects of social media usage .midgrey[(Asimovic et al., 2022, Allcott et al., 2020, Arceneaux and Ladd 2023)]
   
--

- **Problem II **: Fully deactivating WhatsApp users has ethical and empirical challenges:

   - More embedded in users' personal and professional lives compared to feed-based .midgrey[((Rossini et al 2021; Gil de Zuniga et al 2021))] 
   
   - Most used for diversity of purposes other than sharing/receiving political information .midgrey[(Newman et. 2024)]
   
   - Leads to a subject pool with limited inferential value.

---
class:middle

## Our Design: WhatsApp Partial Deactivation

--

-  **Experiment:** Friction + Incentive to reduce WhatsApp usage:

   - **Time Treatment:** Add time limit for WhatsApp usage per day + Limit Usage to 5min per day;
   - **Media Treatment**: Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp, and do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp;

--

- **Multicountry Design:** selected some of the largest Global South countries having democratic elections in 2024.

  - India: **General Election** Spring 2024
  - South Africa: **Presidential Election** Spring 2024
  - Brazil: **Local Election** Fall 2024

--

- **Duration:** 

   - **Treatment**: Change settings and behavior for 4 weeks (one month) leading up to election in three countries
   
--

- **Outcomes:** Information consumption + Attitudes

# Hypotheses

---
class:middle

## Theoretical Expectations

We posit our interventions will affect the information consumption through three distinct mechanisms: 

--

**Direct exposure mechanism:**

- Misinformation and polarizing content frequently spreads anonymously through viral multimedia content (.midgrey[Resende et al., 2019, Garimella et al., 2018]). 

- Easy to share, quasi-anonymous, no author metadata

--

**Enhance Attention:**

- More purposefully select type of content they engage with online, reduce lazy consumption (.midgrey[Rand et al., 2019])

--

**Force users to prioritize relevant engagements/one-on-one:**

   - Information finds users primarily through incidental exposure on medium/large WhatsApp Groups. (.midgrey[Stroud et al., 2022, Schafer 2023])

--

---
class:middle
## Hypotheses

--

#### `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Information Effects:

- Reduce exposure to (mis)information.
- Reduce exposure to online toxicity + uncivil political discussions.
- Improve accuracy discernment

--

--

#### `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Consequences on Political Attitudes:

- Reduce Partisan and Ethnic Affective Polarization.
- Reduce Ideological Polarization (Issue-Based).
- Reduce Candidate favorability. 

--

--

#### `r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Consequences on Non-Political Attitudes:

- Increase Subjective Well-Being (+ Substitution Effects)

## Compliance Results

knitr::include_graphics("output/plot_compliance_main.png")
```

---
class:  middle

### Exposure to and Belief in News Headlines 


- Participants are shown 8 news headlines; asked (a) whether they have seen this news before & (b) whether they think the news is true  

- Four headlines are true news; four are misinformation stories  

- Count how many (a) recalled & (b) accurately identified as T/F  


---
class:middle
## Exposure of Rumors and True News

Limiting WhatsApp usage reduces exposure to misinformation & news  


```{r out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("output_mpsa/recall.png")
```

---
class:  middle
## Belief Accuracy

A short-term reduction in exposure does not translate to changes in accuracy judgments  

```{r out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("output_mpsa/accuracy.png")
```


---
class:  middle
## Uncivil content more broadly 

Using several different items, we find that limiting WhatsApp usage also reduces exposure to online incivility and low-quality political discourse

## Downstream Effects: Measuring Polarization


- Participants are asked about their feelings, traits and willingness to engage with voters/members of two main parties and ethnic/religious groups in *each* country

- We also ask their feelings towards the leaders of the parties

- And their agreement across several policy issues salient in the election

### Are these nulls effects consistent with other studies? 

--

**Yes**. Other studies with changes in consumption, but nulls on political attitudes:

--

- Multimedia whatsapp deactivation in Brazil, 2022 election .midgrey[(Ventura et al., 2025)]

--

- Recent Facebook/Instagram deactivation experiment in US and France .midgrey[(Allcott et al., 2024, Arceunaux et al., 2024)]

--

- Changing Facebook feed to chronological instead of algorithmic .midgrey[(Guess et al., 2023)]

--

- Removing re-shares from people's Facebook News Feed .midgrey[(Nyhan et al., 2024)]

--

- Installing a browser to signal when people are navigating on low-quality news websites  .midgrey[(Aslett et al., 2022)]

--

- And experiments incentivizing participants to take a "news vacation" for two weeks .midgrey[(Wojcieszak et al., 2022)]

### Downstream consequences on Non-Political Attitudes and Substitutes

Using several well-being items, we find that limiting WhatsApp usage makes participants feel better (happier, less anxious, less concerned about others)

--

 **This occurs alongside increased offline activity.**

## Key Takeaways

--

- WhatsApp is an important channel through which voters receive misinformation and news in major Global South democracies 

--

- Reduced exposure to such information does not mechanically affect accuracy perceptions 

--

- In the context of elections, WhatsApp also increases exposure to toxic content and uncivil political discussions

--

   - ...none of this change meaningfully political attitudes (at least not within a short electoral period) 

--

- Yet limiting WhatsApp usage **also** improves overall subjective well-being, and these effects are associated with higher time spent on offline activities.
