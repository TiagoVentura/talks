### Multimedia Deactivation Experiment in Brazil, 2022

--
`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Problem**: Fully deactivating WhatsApp is neither possible nor ideal

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Partial Deactivation:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Mechanism:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

### Exposure to and Belief in News Headlines 


- Participants are shown 8 news headlines; asked (a) whether they have seen this news before & (b) whether they think the news is true  

- Four headlines are true news; four are misinformation stories  

- Count how many (a) recalled & (b) accurately identified as T/F

## Downstream Effects: Measuring Polarization


- Participants are asked about their feelings towards with voters of two main Presidential Candidates (Lula and Bolsonaro) -- Affective Polarization

- We also ask their willingness to engage with voters from these candidates -- Social Polarization

- And their agreement across several policy issues salient in the election -- Ideological Polarization

## Discussion


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the short-term causal effects] of exposure to misinformation on WhatsApp on political attitudes.**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Limitation:** single-country, low-powered study: effects are likely larger among subgroups more exposure to misinformation, and vary contextually.

### Multi-Country Deactivation Experiment

- **Problem**: Single country studies have limited power to speak of contextual effects (and in our case, limited statistical power)

- **Summary**: Multicountry extension across three major Global South countries; Brazil, India and South Africa

- **Stronger Treatment**: Replicate Multimedia Deactivation + Time Reduction

- **More statistical power and external validity**: ~ 2500 participants across the three countries.

### Multi-Country WhatsApp Partial Deactivation Experiment

--

-  **Design:** Partial Deactivation -> Friction + Incentive to reduce usage:

   - **Media Treatment**: Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp, and do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp;
   - **Time Treatment:** Add time limit for WhatsApp usage per day + Limit Usage to 5min per day;


--

- **Duration:** 

   - **Treatment**: Change settings and behavior for 4 weeks (one month) leading up to election in three countries
   - **Control**: Change ONLY behavior for 3 days.
   
--

- **Multicountry Design:** selected some of the largest Global South countries having democratic elections in 2024.

  - India: **General Election** Spring 2024
  - South Africa: **Presidential Election** Spring 2024
  - Brazil: **Local Election** Fall 2024

## Exposure of Rumors and True News

Limiting WhatsApp usage reduces exposure to misinformation & news

class:  middle
## Belief Accuracy

A short-term reduction in exposure does not translate to changes in accuracy judgments

## Uncivil content more broadly 

Using several different items, we find that limiting WhatsApp usage also reduces exposure to online incivility and low-quality political discourse

### Are these nulls effects consistent with other studies? 

--

**Yes**. Other studies with changes in consumption, but nulls on political attitudes:


- Multimedia whatsapp deactivation in Brazil, 2022 election .midgrey[(Ventura et al., 2025)]

- Recent Facebook/Instagram deactivation experiment in US and France .midgrey[(Allcott et al., 2024, Arceunaux et al., 2024)]


- Changing Facebook feed to chronological instead of algorithmic .midgrey[(Guess et al., 2023)]


- Removing re-shares from people's Facebook News Feed .midgrey[(Guess et al., 2024)]

- Installing a browser to signal when people are navigating on low-quality news websites  .midgrey[(Aslett et al., 2022)]

- And experiments incentivizing participants to take a "news vacation" for two weeks .midgrey[(Wojcieszak et al., 2022)]

### Downstream consequences on Non-Political Attitudes and Substitutes

Using several well-being items, we find that limiting WhatsApp usage makes participants feel better (happier, less anxious, less concerned about others)

--

 **This occurs alongside increased offline activity.**

## Key Takeaways

--

- WhatsApp is an important channel through which voters receive misinformation and news in major Global South democracies 

--

- Reduced exposure to such information does not mechanically affect accuracy perceptions 

--

- In the context of elections, WhatsApp also increases exposure to toxic content and uncivil political discussions

--

   - ...none of this change meaningfully political attitudes (at least not within a short electoral period) 

--

- Yet limiting WhatsApp usage **also** improves overall subjective well-being, and these effects are associated with higher time spent on offline activities.
