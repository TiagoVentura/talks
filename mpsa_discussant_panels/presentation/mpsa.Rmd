### Even though WhatsApp has received a huge attention from the media and policy makers, no study has so far identified causal effects of WhatsApp on politics.

## Our Design: Multimedia Deactivation on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Solution:** Cut channels through which users' are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .red[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., ND).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp 
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil
- **End:** three days after the voting day

## Hypotheses

H1: Deactivated users will report lower levels of previous exposure to FALSE rumors.

H2a: Deactivated  will display a higher ability to accurately identify FALSE rumors.

H2b Deactivated users will display lower levels of mainstream news knowledge.

H3: Deactivated will display lower levels of outgroup political polarization.

H4: Deactivated will display higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being.

## Discussion


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to true news.**

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .**The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the causal effects] of WhatsApp on political attitudes.**
--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

#  BUT...

---

class:middle

### It would be a mistake to conclude that WhatsApp plays no role in politics.

--

- Scope conditions: focus on direct effects of WhatsApp. 

--

- Do not rule out the use of WhatsApp as a mobilization and organizational tool by malicious actors. 

--

- Largers effect might exist exactly in hard to reach populations.

--

- Small effect size vs Power

--

- Electoral context + Motivated Reasoning

## Next steps. 

--

### Replication, Replication, Replication

--

**Multi-Country Study**

- Contextual variation

- Partial vs full deactivation

- In and out of election periods

## Examples of Misinformation Outcomes

### False Item: 

_Only complete votes are counted by the electoral justice. If the voter only votes for the President, and votes blank for all the other races, the vote is considered a partial vote, and will be annulled_

### True Item:

_After consecutive reductions, the current oil price in Brazil is below the global average value_
