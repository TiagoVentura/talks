#### .fade[WhatsApp is a worldwide popular end-to-end encrypted messaging app allowing both direct and ingroup communications with close to 2 billion around the world]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Usage in Brazil]

- .red[66% of the Brazilian eligible voters] has a social media account, and .red[65% have an WhatsApp account] ([Datafolha 2018](http://media.folha.uol.com.br/datafolha/2018/10/27/44cc2204230d2fd45e18b039ee8c07a6.pdf)) – 150 million people in 2022. 



- Most used app for all purposes: .red[talk to family & friends, do business & pay bills, consume news, talk politics, among others] ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021)). 



- Used by .red[48% of population to read news], despite having no “news feed” ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021))

## Field Experiment: An WhatsApp Media-Constrained Deactivation

---
###  Intervention 
Deactivation experiments have been recently used to causally identify the effects of social media on users' behavior ans attitudes .red[(Asimovic et al 2021 and Alcott et al 2020)]. Deactivating WhatsApp users is **theorethically and empirically unfeasible**.


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Solution:** .black[cut channels through which users' are exposed to misinformation  and polarizing content]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp
- Dot not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Two week before presidential elections in Brazil
- **End:** One week after the voting day

## Ways to Measure Compliance

To measure compliance, we will ask participants to upload through a qualtrics survey screenshots of their WhatsApp.

## Outcomes

--
#### .darkblue[Misinformation] 

- False Headlines published on fact-checking webpages during the month of the experiment + True headlines from mainstream media.

--

#### .darkblue[Polarization]

- Affective polarization (Feeling Thermomether)
- Social Polarization (Watching the world cup with an outgroup)
- Issue Polarization (Abortion, gun control, etc..)
- False Polarization ('Where do I observe the two main candidates?')

--
#### .darkblue[Subjective Well-being]

- How did you feel last week? (Happy, Anxious, etc...)

## Hypotheses


.pull-right-wide[

H1a: Users using the Media-Constrained WhatsApp will display a .red[higher ability to accurately identify FALSE headlines] compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.

H1b: Users using the Media-Constrained WhatsApp will display .red[lower levels of knowledge on mainstream news headlines] compared to their counterparts  using the regular WhatsApp.

H2: Users using the Media-Constrained WhatsApp  will display .red[lower levels of outgroup partisan polarization] compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.


H3: Users using the Media-Constrained WhatsApp will display .red[higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being] compared to their counterparts using the regular WhatsApp.

## One-Week Pilot Study

---
class:middle, 
## Pilot Summary


**Recruitment**: Four days using Facebook Ads

**Experimental Condition:**

- **Treatment** Full-week with automatic download disabled
- **Control**: Three days with no-media.

**Experiment Assignment:** After uploading proof of disabling automatic download of media.

**Responses:**
  - 540 complete responses
  - 317 passed  the filters
  - 74 invited to joint the expeirment (August 19-20)

## Pilot Analysis: Attrition Rate

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Results]

.center[
```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("attrition_rate.png")
```
]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Notes]

We recruited 540 completes in the screening, from which 317 passed all the screening questions. 

To invite participants, we block randomized on gender, education and age to select 74 out of 317. This probably give us a lower bound for the attrition rate.

In addition, we started with email communication, and moved later to direct WhatsApp messages. The later is way more effective.

## Open Questions

#### Mechanisms for misinformation

- Working with exposure (Have you seen this headline before?).  What else is important to be included in the survey?

#### Headlines selection
- Any advice on how to select the headlines? 

    - .red[Should we take advantage of the compliance survey and  add some headline tasks while collecting screenshots for compliance?]

#### Compliance
 
#### Descriptive information
