## Social Media: The misinformation turn

---
## An Emerging Field 

.center[
```{r out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/research_misinformation.png")
```
]

---
class:middle

## What we know: 

- Externally-valid causal claims are hard, often small in size, and context-dependent.

- Most of the evidence come from a few countries (advanced democracies).

- And from a few platforms (mostly Twitter, and to some extent Facebook).

---
class:middle

## For years, WhatsApp has been the main social media applicattion in many Global South democracies.

.panel[.panel-name[Usage in Brazil]


- .red[66% of the Brazilian eligible voters] has a social media account, and .red[65% have an WhatsApp account] ([Datafolha 2018](http://media.folha.uol.com.br/datafolha/2018/10/27/44cc2204230d2fd45e18b039ee8c07a6.pdf)) – 150 million people in 2022. 


- Most used app for all purposes: .red[talk to family & friends, do business & pay bills, consume news, talk politics, among others] ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021)). 


- Used by .red[48% of population to read news], despite having no “news feed” ([Reuters Institute, 2021](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2021))


- Across the world, .red[Brazilians are the most concerned about misinformation]. And among the most active social media users


- And .red[WhatsApp is the main social media application] where users report to see more misinformation.

### Even though WhatsApp has received a huge attention from the media and policy makers, no study has so far identified causal effects of WhatsApp on political outcomes.

## Field Experiment: An WhatsApp Multi-Media Deactivation during the Brazilian Election

---
class:middle

## Motivation

Deactivation experiments have been recently used to causally identify the effects of social media on users' behavior and attitudes .red[(Asimovic et al 2021 and Alcott et al 2020)]. 

--

#### Deactivating WhatsApp users is **theoretically and empirically unfeasible**.

- Costs of deactivating on human subjects are too high. 

- Findings from subjects enrolled in a complete deactivation were unlikely to be feasible (issues on external validity)


---
class: middle

## Our Design

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Solution:** Cut channels through which users' are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content .red[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., ND).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp 
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil
- **End:** three days after the voting day

## Hypotheses

H1: Deactivated users will report lower levels of previous exposure to FALSE rumors.

H2a: Deactivated  will display a higher ability to accurately identify FALSE rumors.

H2b Deactivated users will display lower levels of mainstream news knowledge.

H3: Deactivated will display lower levels of outgroup political polarization.

H4: Deactivated will display higher levels of the aggregated index of subjective well-being.

## Discussion


--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **WhatsApp is an important vector through which voters receive misinformation in Brazil at .red[a higher rate] compared to news.**

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .**The null results provide support for a .red[minimalist view of the causal effects] of WhatsApp on political attitudes.**
--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  **Exposure to misinformation .red[does not] mechanically affect attitudes**

#  BUT...

---

class:middle

### It would be a mistake to conclude that WhatsApp plays no role in politics.

--

- Scope conditions: focus on direct effects of WhatsApp. 

--

- Do not rule out the use of WhatsApp as a mobilization and organizational tool by malicious actors. 

--

- Largers effect might exist exactly in hard to reach populations.

--

- Small effect size vs Power

--

- Electoral context + Motivated Reasoning

## Next steps. 

--

### Replication, Replication, Replication

--

**Multi-Country Study**

- Contextual variation

- Partial vs full deactivation

- In and out of election periods

## Examples of Misinformation Outcomes

### False Item: 

_Only complete votes are counted by the electoral justice. If the voter only votes for the President, and votes blank for all the other races, the vote is considered a partial vote, and will be annulled_

### True Item:

_After consecutive reductions, the current oil price in Brazil is below the global average value_
