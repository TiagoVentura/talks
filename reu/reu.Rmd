### My Research

I am **Computational Social Scientist**, which means I mix **computer science/data science** techniques applied to **social science** questions (mostly politics), and vice-versa. 

--

- **Using Twitter data**: understand why people [share content on online](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/19401612211057068?journalCode=hijb#core-collateral-metrics) and formation of [ideological bubbles](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/73/1/14/6767335?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false#377639098) on social media, and the composition of online and offline echo-chambers 

--

- **Using Facebook Data + Experiments**: the effects of exposure to [streaming chats on perceptions of public debates](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article-abstract/71/6/947/6415947?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false) and partisan and [toxicity dynamics](https://journalqd.org/article/view/2573/1820) on streaming chats (twitch or facebook lives)

--

- **Using Survey Experiments**: sharing of vaccine fact-checking corrections online due to [framing effects](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53337-0) and [partisan identity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14614448231193709)

--

- **Using large-scale field experiments**: how social media usage affects politics - on [WhatsApp](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4457400) and [across feed based apps](https://globalsocialmediastudy.com/)

--

- **Ongoing projects:** using LLMs to help people identify misinformation rumors, measuring the prevalence of human-generated vs ai-generated content on social media, and developing methods to incorporate metadata from text on LLM models.

## Plans for today:

- What do we know about the role of social media on society?

- Experimentation as an approach: the role of deactivation designs

- Exposure Beyond Traditional Feeds: WhatsApp Multimedia Deactivation Experiments

- Ongoing project: 

  - Multi-Country WhatsApp Deactivation
  
  - Global Social Media Screen time Experiment 

- Break

- WhatsApp Data Donation Tool

- In-class Activity: Designing your own experiment

### The Effects of Social Media: What Do We (Think We) Know?

Recent meta-analysis (.midgrey[Lorenz-Spreen et. al. 2022])  on this topic (496 articles).


- **Social media as a "double-edge sword"**:
   - .red[Positive associations] with information consumption & political participation 
   - .red[Negative associations] with trust in institutions and polarization


- **Context Matters**:
   - Some evidence of more positive outcomes in autocracies and emerging
democracies vs. established ones
  - Negative outcomes, such as decline in trust, were more pronounced in established democracies
  - Other characteristics may matter, i.e. offline networks and activities,
linguistic diversity

## Challenges to study the impacts of social media

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Privacy and Data Access for Independent Researchers


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Observational data can tell us little about causal effects of social media.

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` .red[Randomized interventions allow us to isolate causal effects.] 

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")`  Not many interventions are possible for researchers without collaboration with the industry

### Social Media Deactivation Experiments

- Consider an .red[hypothetical world] in which: 

  - one population where social media has been adopted and widely used as we know
  - another population where social media does not exist. 

- In the .red[absence of this perfect counterfactual], researchers have  proxied for this scenario by deploying a class of experimental designs commonly referred to as .red[deactivation studies]

- Users are randomly instructed to temporarily reduce/deactivated their social media usage 

   - Facebook in US, Bosnia, France and Cyprus
   - Instagram and Facebook in the recent 2020 US election
   - WhatsApp Multimedia in Brazil, 2022.

### WhatsApp Multimedia Deactivation Experiment

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Our Design:** Cut the primary channels through which users are exposed to misinformation and polarizing content: videos, images and audios .midgrey[(Machado et al., 2019; Resende et al., 2019; Garimella and Tyson, 2018; Garimella and Eckles, 2020; Batista Pereira et al., 2023).]

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Experiment:** Offer respondents a monetary incentive to

- Disable their automatic download of media on WhatsApp.
- Do not purposefully click and watch any media on WhatsApp.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment Period:** Three weeks:

- **Start:** Three weeks before general election in Brazil.
- **End:** three days after the voting day.

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Outcomes:** 
- Exposure and Beliefs to online misinformation, 
- Outgroup polarization 
- Subjective well-being.

## More WhatsApp Experiments: is Brazil just a fluke?


`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Extend our previous design to two other elections**: India and South Africa, 2024

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Two distinct interventions:** 

-  Time: Limit daily WhatsApp usage to 10 minutes
-  Media: Do not consume multimedia content received via WhatsApp 
  
`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Treatment and control**

- Treatment: Change settings and behavior for 4 weeks (one month)
leading up to election
- Control: Change only behavior for 3 days a month before election

### Global Social Media Experiment

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` A global study testing the .red[causal impact of social media] usages reduction around the globe.

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Open call for collaborators: 

- Recruited more than 700 potential collaborators across 76 countries

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` In each country, participants will be randomly assigned to temporarily .red[reduce their social media usage] for two weeks 

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Main Points: 

- Collects data across the .red[many countries] ~> better powered to measure contextual effects

- .red[Multi-platform design]: major social media app (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, Twitter/X)

### Setting up a Global Collaboration

A large-scale project as this requires .red[substantive knowledge] and .red[scholars] on the ground across multiple countries:

- Inspired by prior "Global Studies": 
   - [International Collaboration on Social and Moral Psychology: Covid-19](https://icsmp-covid19.netlify.app/)
   - [International Collaboration to Understand Climate Action](https://manylabsclimate.wordpress.com/)
   
   
- On March 27, we launched an open call for collaborators:
   - Over 700 researchers residing in 76 countries signed up
   

- All researchers received a call to sign a [collaboration agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddid4wZlDy9kazVcYYaW2nimCTzhyPGQ-QYCy2SLSW8/edit#heading=h.9vexkqhq787q)

   - Social Polarization
   - Misperceptions using traits polarization
   

- **Subjective well-being:**
  - Self-Reported feelings scale

## What to take from this?

--
`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Substantively:** The role of social media on shaping political attitutes is likely more nuanced than we see in the news. 
  
   - Bad content is overly concentrated on a community of users who are seek for this content. 
      -  and social media tends to make bad content more visible
      
   - People still watch a lot of TV!
   - On average, effects are probably just null. 

--

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **As a scientific enterprise:**
  
   - More research collecting non-western data
   - More creative experiments
   - More alternative ways to collect data (while social media companies are not regulated)

## Designing your own experiment

In the next 30 minutes, I want you to think about an experimental design you would like to design. Here are the instructions: 

- Topics: must be about misinformation and the digital world
    - e.g interventions to reduce beliefs
    - e.g. interventions to understand what make people more willing to beleif or share or receiving misinfo
    - e.g. other deactivation designs

- Design: you .red[must] clearly articulate what treatment and control would be

- Outcomes: you .red[must] define which outcomes you want to measure. 

- Example: read this [grant proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KYF7EGBx2wKrSj3fWbYIbEAT5C1qgN67d9zCY6L-qOc/edit) I am working on. Feel free to use this proposal as a baseline for you to design your own interventions.
