### The Effects of Digital Media on Democracy

One of todayâ€™s most relevant issue is whether social media usage is causally related to political outcomes, such as beliefs for misinformation, episodes of offline violence, polarization, and subjective well-being.

A recent meta-analysis (.midgrey[Lorenz-Spreen et. al. 2022])  on this topic (496 articles) found:

- Social media as a "double-edge sword":
  - Overall .red[positive association] with information consumption and political participation
  - But it .red[erodes] trust in institutions and increases polarization

- Context Matters:
  - Positive outcomes, such as political participation, tends to have larger effects on autocracies and emerging democracies
  - Negative outcomes, such as decline in trust, were more pronounced in established democracies

### Global Social Media Experiment

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` A global study testing the .red[causal impact of social media] usages reduction around the globe.

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Open call for collaborators: 

- Recruited more than 700 potential collaborators across 76 countries

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` In each country, participants will be randomly assigned to temporarily .red[reduce their social media usage] for two weeks 

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` Main Points: 

- Collects data across the .red[many countries] ~> better powered to measure contextual effects

- .red[Multi-platform design]: major social media app (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Youtube, Twitter/X)

### Setting up a Global Collaboration

A large-scale project as this requires .red[substantive knowledge] and .red[scholars] on the ground across multiple countries:

- Inspired by prior "Global Studies": 
   - [International Collaboration on Social and Moral Psychology: Covid-19](https://icsmp-covid19.netlify.app/)
   - [International Collaboration to Understand Climate Action](https://manylabsclimate.wordpress.com/)
   
   
- On March 27, we launched an open call for collaborators:
   - Over 700 researchers residing in 76 countries signed up
   

- All researchers received a call to sign a [collaboration agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ddid4wZlDy9kazVcYYaW2nimCTzhyPGQ-QYCy2SLSW8/edit#heading=h.9vexkqhq787q)

- Next step: forming country teams and define roles:
  - Translation of surveys
  - Coordinating survey recruitment and quality checks
  - Preparing data analysis

### Project Outputs

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Main Output**: Registered Report (Nature)/Global Meta Paper

- Leadership team: Drafting, revising, and submitting the manuscript with the help of collaborators

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Secondary Papers:**

- After data collection, up to 20% of the data will be made available to all for exploratory analysis. 
- After collaborators send us a pre-registration of the desired analysis for early access to the data. 
- Secondary papers can be submitted using the dataset after our main paper is accepted for publication.

`r icons::fontawesome("arrow-alt-circle-right")` **Country-Specific Paper:**

- Collaborators  are welcome to publish papers from the country data and add additional measures

### Research Design


.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Recruitment]

Overall, our design combines a two-wave panel + time reduction interventions

- Recruitment through online survey panels

- Pre-screening survey:
  - use social media on their cellphones
  - adults older 18
  - willingness to join the experiment
  - willingness to upload screenshots 
  - pre-treatment measure for outcomes
  
]


.panel[.panel-name[Intervention]

A few days after responding to the pre-screening survey, participants will receive an invite to join the full study. 

**Baseline Survey:** only assign participants to their conditions

**Treatment Condition:**
 
 - **Duration**: .red[two weeks] intervention
 - **Apps**: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, Twitter/X
 - **Reduction**: Five minutes each app per day
 
**Control Condition:**
 
 - **Duration**: .red[one day] time reduction
 - **Apps**: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, Twitter/X
 - **Reduction**: Five minutes each app per day

.panel[.panel-name[Post-Treatment Survey]

Two weeks later, we invite participants to answer a post-treatment survey:

- Measure primary outcomes

- Secondary outcomes from other papers

- Country Specific Outcomes

- Compliance Checks

### Outcomes and Hypotheses

Registered Report (to be submitred to Nature), looking at the impact of social media usage reduction on: 

- **News knowledge**
   - Battery of true headlines + false placebo headlines from the weeks of the intervention

- **Outgroup Polarization (Partisan and Ethnicity):**
   - Affective Polarization
   - Social Polarization
   - Misperceptions using traits polarization
   

- **Subjective well-being:**
  - Self-Reported feelings scale

class: middle
### Outcomes and Hypotheses

Our directional hypotheses are largely based on previous deactivation studies:

- H1: Social media usage reduction will decrease news knowledge.

- H2: Social media usage reduction will improve positive feelings toward political (and non-political) out-groups.

- H3: Social media usage reduction will improve subjective well-being.

### Heterogenous Effects

An exciting component of our study is to understand contextual variation of causal effects of social media. We plan to pre-register four other heterogeneous hypothesis

- H4: Stronger positive effects of News Knowledge conditional on high/low income countries .midgrey[(Reuters News Report, 2022)]

- H5: Stronger positive effects on outgroup feeling for participants embedded in heterogenous offline networks .midgrey[(Asimovic et. al. 2021)]

- H6: Stronger positive effects on outgroup feelings conditional on levels of democracy and high/low income .midgrey[(Lorenz-Spreen et. al. 2022)]

- H7: Positive effects on well-being will be larger in higher-income (as compared to lower-income) countries .midgrey[(Ghai et. al. 2022)]

### Questions we would love to get feedback!

Some decision are still pretty much open for discussion:

- **Payment of the control group**

- **Duration of the intervention**

- **Substitution Effects**

- **Additional outcomes for secondary papers**
