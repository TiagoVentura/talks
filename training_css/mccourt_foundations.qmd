## Plans for today 

- Introduction: Who am I and how I got here.

- Training Graduate Students for a Career in Computational Social Science [(article here)](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kgjn2/)

- Lots of Discussion

- **Professor Tiago Ventura (he/him):**

    -   Assistant Professor at McCourt School.
    -   Before that: Postdoc at [CSMAP-NYU](https://csmapnyu.org/) and a Researcher at Twitter.
    -   PhD from the University of Maryland, College Park
    -   PhD from State University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

## Computational Social Science


> We define [computational social science]{.red} as a field that engages the social sciences and data science by applying **novel digital and digitized data** and **computational methods** to advance social scientific understanding of human behavior

## CSS: Current stage of the field

  - Increasing number social scientists assuming positions as computational social scientists in academic and non-academic organizations. 

  - Most  graduate programs do not yet offer systematic training in CSS

  - Or advising for students interested in CSS

## Formalizing the Hidden Curriculum


  - Step 1: Learning Data Science Skills

  - Step 2: Build a CSS Portfolio

  - Step 3: Engage in the CSS Networks



## Step 1: Learning Data Science Skills

::: incremental

- Programming fluency in R and/or Python.

- Experience with data management, particularly with managing large, messy, and unstructured data.

- End-to-end research pipeline + Domain expertise.

- Build strong foundations in statistical inference, causal inference and machine learning. 

:::

## Step 2: Building a Computational Social Science Portfolio

::: incremental

- Engagement with social and applied aspects of a data science.

- Learn and use Git/Github for ALL YOUR PROJECTS. 

- Make your data science project available on Github and write blog posts about them

:::



## Step 3: Connecting with Computational Social Scientists

::: incremental

- Attend CSS conferences and focus on horizontal networking

- Internships are hugely important (All tech companies offer + non-profits, such as Civic Digital Fellowship and Data Science for Social Good Fellowship) 

- Online networks: linkedin + Twitter + Github
